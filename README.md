# Learning Robotics on the Jetson TX2 - Lights Out Robot

Are you ready to learn how to use your Jetson TX2 for robotics applications? In this project, you'll learn how to get started using your TX2 to apply AI to your robotics application. You will get the chance to build a simple “Lights Out” robot that will use reinforcement learning to push buttons and turn out corresponding LEDs. We will cover how to wire up, program, and run the robot. Additionally, we will discuss the basics of applied reinforcement learning.

## Getting Started

[Bill of Materials](https://github.com/udacity/gym-jetson/blob/master/BOM.md) 

[Assembling the Robot](https://github.com/udacity/gym-jetson/blob/master/Assembly.md) 

Jupyter notebooks have been created for this project. The first notebook covers taking control of the robot, including assembly and wiring of the electronic components, testing and troubleshooting getting the arm to hit the buttons and have the lights turn on and off. A second notebook discusses the reinforcement learning component, where we program the robot to play a game.

To launch the [notebook](https://github.com/udacity/gym-jetson/blob/master/0_Introduction.ipynb) locally from your machine, run the following commands:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/gym-jetson.git
$ cd gym-jetson
$ jupyter notebook 0_Introduction.ipynb
```
