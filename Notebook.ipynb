    "The setup has four LEDs.  We enumerate the LEDs starting with zero, so that the yellow LED is at position `0`, the red LED is at position `1`, and so on.  Each LED is connected to a button that is used to turn it off.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![LEDs](images/LEDs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The game round begins when **one** of the four LEDs is turned on, and the robotic arm starts at a position hovering over one of the four buttons.  The score always starts at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each point in the game, the robot has three potential movements (or **actions**) at its disposal.  It can:\n",
    "- `0` - move **L**eft one position,\n",
    "- `1` - stay at the current position and **P**ush, or\n",
    "- `2` - move **R**ight one position.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the robot chooses an action, its score is deducted one point.  While most actions have intuitive effects, there are a few special cases that are worth mentioning:\n",
    "- The lit LED is turned off when the robot pushes its corresponding button, but pushing buttons connected to unlit LEDs has no effect (i.e., they are never turned on by the robot).  \n",
    "- If the robotic arm is hovering over the leftmost button at location `0` and decides to move left, we imagine that the arm hits an imaginary wall, and the arm stays where it is.  Likewise, if the arm is hovering over the button at position `3` and decides to move right, then at the next point in the game, the arm will have maintained its position at location `3` (the rightmost location in the line).\n",
    "\n",
    "The round ends when the robot pushes the correct button to turn off the lit LED.  Your goal in this notebook is to implement an algorithm that can learn from gameplay the optimal strategy to attain the highest (or least negative) score at each round.  To accomplish this, your robot will need to learn how to turn off the lit LED in as few movements as possible.  "

    "You may have noticed that the winning game strategy is very straightforward to hard code.  With this in mind, if you are new to RL, you might wonder why an RL technique would not be overkill.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the fact is that in the field of RL, it is very common to use simple games with well-defined rules **to build intuition** for how to design algorithms to best accomplish more complex tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the RL setting, we assume that the robot does not have the domain knowledge to know what \"left\", \"push\", or \"right\" means.  The robot only knows that it has three possible actions, and it needs to figure out how to select from these actions to consistently attain the highest possible score.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the robot as a computer player with full access to a keyboard that only contains three keys, where you further assume the player does not know any of the game controls.  Despite this missing information, the player must nonetheless learn how to beat the game.  \n",
    "\n",
    "And, similar to how you can imagine the human player would learn, the robot will closely watch its score in the game to gauge how well it is doing.  If it is not performing well, it will amend its strategy to do better.  \n",

    "The algorithm that you will use to determine the best gameplay strategy is remarkably intuitive.  The robot will learn primarily through trial-and-error, while using its score as a feedback mechanism to hone its strategy.  Its initial behavior will be incredibly random, as it tries out many different moves (or actions) in the game, to see how its score is affected.  The main idea behind the algorithm is to train the robot to leverage its gameplay experience to gradually obtain a well-informed strategy that attains a relatively high score.  \n",

    "- The robot's next choice was to move **L**eft, so it moved to position `0` and the score was deducted another point.\n",

    "It is relatively straightforward to determine what these estimates _should_ be, _if_ they are completely accurate.  For instance, consider `Q[3,1]`.  This value corresponds to state `3`, which corresponds to the case where the game starts with the lit LED at position `0`, and the robotic arm is at position `3` (*... please verify this in the section above!*).  If the robot selects action `1` as its first move in the game, then this corresponds to pushing in the current location, which results in a score of `-1`.  Then, at this point, if the agent plays optimally, it can obtain a final score of **at most** `-5`, obtained by selecting actions `0`, `0`, `0`, and `1` to end the game in four more moves.  The agent will try to estimate this value (`Q[3,1]=-5`), along with all other values in the array, from gameplay.  And - amazingly - it will refine these estimates while simultaneously trying to determine the optimal policy.  That is, it does not need to know the optimal policy *a priori* before forming these estimates!\n",
    "\n",
    "This array is deeply connected to the optimal policy.  What's particularly worth noting is that in the event that we have a perfect estimate of all of the values in `Q`, we can quickly use it to obtain the optimal policy.  To see this, suppose for now that the robot has a perfect estimate of all of the entries in the `Q` array.  Then, it can get the corresponding optimal action corresponding to any state `s` simply by looking at the `s`-th row in `Q`, or `Q[s]`.  As an example, if `s=3`, then `Q[3]=[-4, -5, -5]`.  \n",
    "> Then, to get the optimal action corresponding to state `s`, we need only select the action corresponding to the index that maximizes `Q[s]`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case that `s=3`, we see that `-4` is the largest entry in `Q[s]` (which appears at index `0`), and so the optimal action is action `0` (which corresponds to action left).  Take the time now to check that this lines up with both your intuition and the optimal policy above!  To understand more generally why this is the case, note that each entry in `Q[s]` contains the final score if the robot follows the optimal policy, for all moves except (potentially) the first.  Then, one of the three available initial moves must be optimal, and it makes sense that the optimal move will correspond to the action (or index) that yields the largest value in `Q[s]`.  This fact will come in very useful in the next section, when we talk about how to implement the method in more detail."

As described above, we begin by initializing `Q[s,a]=-5` for each `s` and `a`.  Then, the robot plays a single round using the `play_round` function, and the results of the round (in `game_round`) are used to update the estimates in `Q`.  The loop continues for a total of `num_rounds` game rounds, where the agent updates the estimates in `Q` between rounds.  Although the robot will initially be quite bad at choosing game moves, it will demonstrate a high level of skill later in gameplay!\n",

    "We think of each game round as broken into discrete time steps.  At the start of a round, the agent observes the initial state of the game, which we denote by $s_0$.  Using the context provided by the state, the agent has to choose an appropriate action $a_0$ in response.  This action likely changes the state of the game, and we denote the following game state as $s_1$.\n",

    "We can translate this change in game score to the traditional RL framework by saying that the agent received a **reward** of -1.  In particular, we can say the agent received a reward $r_1=-1$ as a result of selecting action $a_0$ after observing state $s_0$.\n",
