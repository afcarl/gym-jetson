However, if we put a resistor in series with the LED in the circuit, we can control the value of the current and the LED will work. We’ll also need one for our transistor switch,  and another for our button circuit The value of resistor or resistors that you need varies depending on your other specific circuit components. You can identify the value of the resistor based on the colour coded stripes, which you will be able to see in the wiring diagram provided.\n",

That means we’ll hook it up to a line we can control with the software and it will in turn make the circuit turn “on” and “off” by closing and opening the circuit, just like a physical switch. The transistor circuit allows us to control the LED with a very small output signal from the system, even one that is too small to drive an LED directly. We will be using small signal NPN transistor [2N2222A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N2222) or similar.\n",

    "The button circuits we are building allow for the Jetson to detect the state of the button input. We also will require something called a pull-down resistor, where when the switch is in an open state, the circuit will be “pulled down” to ground. This prevents something called a “floating pin”, where the signal of the Jetson pin floats between 0 and 1 when the button is not pressed and the circuit is open. With a pull-down resistor, the pin will consistently read 0 when the button is open, and 1 when the button is closed.\n",

We will enable the PWM chip, and write values to the PWM registers to assign a start time and stop time to the servo hat channels. Each channel on the servo hat controls one single servo, and eachof these channels has a unique start and stop address to write values to. The start time and stop time determine when the pulse of the PWM goes high and low. The control signal of the servo is taken from this pulse width.\n",

For example, a 45 degree offset from center would be 207 (45x4.6) counts either more or less than 1250, depending upon the direction you desire the motion to be in.\n",
